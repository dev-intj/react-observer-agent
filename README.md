# react-observer-agent

## 🚧 Project Status & Vision


### 🔬 What This Is

`react-observer-agent` is an **experimental project** by a solo developer exploring whether it's possible to build an AI agent system that:

- Observes a live React app’s state and UI
- Understands what the user is doing and what actions are possible
- Uses large language models (LLMs) to suggest or execute actions, safely
- Does all of this through a simple `<Provider>` and registered tools

My vision is to be able to use it like this:

```jsx
import { AIAgentProvider, registerTool, openAIAdapter } from 'react-observer-agent';
import { useStore } from './store';

const tools = [
  registerTool('goToPage', (path) => navigate(path)),
  registerTool('submitForm', () => handleSubmit()),
];

const getAppState = () => {
  const state = useStore.getState();
  return {
    user: state.user,
    cart: state.cart,
  };
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AIAgentProvider
      model={openAIAdapter({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })}
      state={getAppState}
      tools={tools}
      permissions={{
        canAccess: ['user', 'cart'],
        canExecute: ['goToPage', 'submitForm'],
      }}
    >
      <YourApp />
    </AIAgentProvider>
  );
}
```

This is a personal research initiative — not a commercial product.

### 🎯 Why I'm Building It

Most "AI integrations" in frontend apps today are:
- Shallow (just chats or autocomplete)
- Stateless (no awareness of what’s on the page or in the app)
- Unsafe (not designed to act in complex UIs)

I'm interested in pushing this further — to see if an AI can:
- Understand app structure and user state
- Safely invoke pre-defined actions
- Integrate flexibly with tools like Zustand, Redux, and OpenAI
- Respect privacy and permission boundaries

### 🧪 What I Want to Learn

- Can an AI agent understand enough about a live React app to be useful?
- Can state and action exposure be automated with zero glue code?
- Can I support multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Claude, local) through adapters?
- Can this be done safely, privately, and scalably?

### 🛣️ Roadmap (Experimental Goals)

- 🔜 Manual state observation + tool registry + OpenAI support
- 🔜 DOM awareness + page context mapping
- 🔜 Consent model + permission boundaries
- 🔜 Model adapter layer (Claude, Ollama, etc.)
- 🔜 In-memory agent "short-term memory"
- 🔜 Developer-friendly logging & test tools

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a solo experiment.  
It is **not production-ready**.  
It may change, break, or stop at any time.

If you're at a company curious about intelligent UIs, you're welcome to explore it, fork it, or reach out. Feedback is appreciated.
